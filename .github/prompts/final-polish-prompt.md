## Phase 7: The Final Polish (User Experience)

In 2026, users expect **"Carbon-Aware"** software. We’ll add a subtle feature in the **Angular Material** frontend that changes the UI accent color based on the current grid intensity:

- **Green:** Grid is running on >80% renewables.
- **Amber:** High fossil fuel usage.

### The 2026 Business Model

Since this is a Micro-SaaS, don't charge "per user." In 2026, the winning model is **"Per Metric Ton Tracked"** or **"Per Compliance Report Generated."** This aligns your revenue directly with the value you provide (staying out of legal trouble).

### Your Launch Checklist

1. **JHipster Generation:** Build the core monolith or microservices.
2. **Domain Logic:** Plug in the `CarbonCalculatorService`.
3. **UI:** Implement the Material Dashboard with `ngx-charts`.
4. **DevOps:** Use the Bash scripts to automate the "Data to Declaration" pipeline.

**Would you like me to help you design the SQL schema for the Multi-Tenant "Green Ledger" to ensure total data isolation between your clients?**
